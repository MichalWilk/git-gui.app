# git-gui.app

Simple Automator AppleScript that wraps git-gui as .app and install git through Homebrew if necessary. Tested on macOS 10.13.

* #### If apps stucks at pull/push, then you probably need to validate the authenticity of the host. Just click on the Terminal icon.

* #### If the terminal window remains open after closing the git-gui with:
```
Saving session...
...copying shared history...
...saving history...truncating history files...
...completed.

[Process completed]
```

in Preferences -> Profiles -> Shell set When the shell exits: **Close if the shell exited cleanly**
